# Udemy Course Repo

###### This repository contains code from the projects and exercises from the Udemy Courses in progress and completed by myself.

Current courses in progress: 

- [The Web Developer's BootCamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
- [iOS 10 & Swift 3](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/)

Projects and code are organized by sections and units within the courses. 

Note that not all the projects were completed exactly as instructed in the course, often I like to change features or improve on the given constraints in the project.
